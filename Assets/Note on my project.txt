Thank you for taking the time to look over my project, and review my progress.

I know that my code is not where I would like it to be, and I am missing unit testing.  I do humbly appologize.

I chose to use csv files in conjunction with pandas frameworks, to help keep this project as self contained as I could, while still allowing data manipulation.  Given more time and resources, I would have rather used a sql or mongo database.

I also know given more time, I could make this program work wonderfully, and something that I could be proud of.

Thank you for your time.
